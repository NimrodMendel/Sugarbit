        <h1>10 Tips for Coping with Diabetes Distress</h1>
        <p>
          Managing diabetes can be hard. Sometimes you may feel overwhelmed.
          Having diabetes means that you need to check your blood sugar levels
          often, make healthy food choices, be physically active, remember to
          take your medicine, and make other good decisions about your health
          several times a day. In addition, you may also worry about having low
          or high blood sugar levels, the costs of your medicines, and
          developing diabetes-related complications, such as heart disease or
          nerve damage. Having diabetes can be overwhelming at times. The good
          news is that there are things you can do to cope with diabetes and
          manage stress. When all of this feels like too much to deal with, you
          may have something called diabetes distress. This is when all the
          worry, frustration, anger, and burnout makes it hard for you to take
          care of yourself and keep up with the daily demands of diabetes. The
          good news is that there are things you can do to cope with diabetes
          and manage stress. Here are 10 tips that can help.
        </p>
        <h3>1. Pay attention to your feelings</h3>
        <p>
          Almost everyone feels frustrated or stressed from time to time.
          Dealing with diabetes can add to these feelings and make you feel
          overwhelmed. Having these feelings for more than a week or two may
          signal that you need help coping with your diabetes so that you can
          feel better.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Talk with your health care providers about your feelings</h3>
        <p>
          Let your doctor, nurse, diabetes educator, psychologist, or social
          worker know how you’ve been feeling. They can help you problem-solve
          your concerns about diabetes. They may also suggest that you speak
          with other health care providers to get help.
        </p>
        <h3>
          3. Talk to your health care providers about negative reactions other
          people may have about your diabetes
        </h3>
        <p>
          Your health care providers can help you manage feelings of being
          judged by others because you have diabetes. It is important not to
          feel that you have to hide your diabetes from other people.
        </p>
        <h3>
          4. Ask if help is available for the costs of diabetes medicines and
          supplies
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you are worried about the cost of your medicines, talk with your
          pharmacist and other health care providers. They may know about
          government or other programs that can assist people with costs. You
          can also check with community health centers to see if they know about
          programs that help people get insulin, diabetes medicines, and
          supplies (test trips, syringes, etc.).
        </p>
        <h3>5. Talk with your family and friends</h3>
        <p>
          Tell those closest to you how you feel about having diabetes. Be
          honest about the problems you’re having in dealing with diabetes. Just
          telling others how you feel helps to relieve some of the stress.
          However, sometimes the people around you may add to your stress. Let
          them know how and when you need them to help you.
        </p>{" "}
        <h3>6. Allow loved ones to help you take care of your diabetes</h3>
        <p>
          Those closest to you can help you in several ways. They can remind you
          to take your medicines, help monitor your blood sugar levels, join you
          in being physically active, and prepare healthy meals. They can also
          learn more about diabetes and go with you when you visit your doctor.
          Ask your loved ones to help with your diabetes in ways that are useful
          to you.
        </p>{" "}
        <h3>7. Talk to other people with diabetes</h3>
        <p>
          Other people with diabetes understand some of the things you are going
          through. Ask them how they deal with their diabetes and what works for
          them. They can help you feel less lonely and overwhelmed. Ask your
          health care providers about diabetes support groups in your community
          or online.
        </p>{" "}
        <h3>8. Do one thing at a time</h3>
        <p>
          When you think about everything you need to do to manage your
          diabetes, it can be overwhelming. To deal with diabetes distress, make
          a list of all of the tasks you have to do to take care of yourself
          each day. Try to work on each task separately, one at a time.
        </p>
        <h3>9. Pace yourself</h3>
        <p>
          As you work on your goals, like increasing physical activity, take it
          slowly. You don’t have to meet your goals immediately. Your goal may
          be to walk 10 minutes, three times a day each day of the week, but you
          can start by walking two times a day or every other day.
        </p>
        <h3>10. Take time to do things you enjoy</h3>
        <p>
          Give yourself a break! Set aside time in your day to do something you
          really love; it could be calling a friend, playing a game with your
          children or grandchildren, or working on a fun project. Find out about
          activities near you that you can do with a friend.
        </p>
        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>
          Remember that it’s important to pay attention to your feelings. If you
          notice that you’re feeling frustrated, tired, and unable to make
          decisions about your diabetes care, take action. Tell your family,
          friends, and health care providers. They can help you get the support
          you need.
