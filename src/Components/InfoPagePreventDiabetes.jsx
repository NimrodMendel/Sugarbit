        <h1>13 Ways to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes</h1>
        <p>
          Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people
          worldwide. Uncontrolled cases can cause blindness, kidney failure,
          heart disease and other serious conditions. Before diabetes is
          diagnosed, there is a period where blood sugar levels are high but not
          high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. This is known as prediabetes.
          It’s estimated that up to 70% of people with prediabetes go on to
          develop type 2 diabetes. Fortunately, progressing from prediabetes to
          diabetes isn’t inevitable (1). Although there are certain factors you
          can’t change — such as your genes, age or past behaviors — there are
          many actions you can take to reduce the risk of diabetes. Here are 13
          ways to avoid getting diabetes.
        </p>
        <h3>1. Cut Sugar and Refined Carbs From Your Diet</h3>
        <p>
          Eating foods high in refined carbs and sugar increases blood sugar and
          insulin levels, which may lead to diabetes over time. Avoiding these
          foods may help reduce your risk.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Work Out Regularly</h3>
        <p>
          Performing physical activity on a regular basis can increase insulin
          secretion and sensitivity, which may help prevent the progression from
          prediabetes to diabetes.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Drink Water as Your Primary Beverage</h3>
        <p>
          Drinking water instead of other beverages may help control blood sugar
          and insulin levels, thereby reducing the risk of diabetes.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Lose Weight If You’re Overweight or Obese</h3>
        <p>
          Carrying excess weight, particularly in the abdominal area, increases
          the likelihood of developing diabetes. Losing weight may significantly
          reduce the risk of diabetes.
        </p>
        <h3>5. Quit Smoking</h3>
        <p>
          Smoking is strongly linked to the risk of diabetes, especially in
          heavy smokers. Quitting has been shown to reduce this risk over time.
        </p>{" "}
        <h3>6. Follow a Very-Low-Carb Diet</h3>
        <p>
          Following a ketogenic or very-low-carb diet can help keep blood sugar
          and insulin levels under control, which may protect against diabetes.
        </p>{" "}
        <h3>7. Watch Portion Sizes</h3>
        <p>
          Avoiding large portion sizes can help reduce insulin and blood sugar
          levels and decrease the risk of diabetes.
        </p>{" "}
        <h3>8. Avoid Sedentary Behaviors</h3>
        <p>
          Avoiding sedentary behaviors like excessive sitting has been shown to
          reduce your risk of getting diabetes.
        </p>
        <h3>9. Eat a High-Fiber Diet</h3>
        <p>
          Consuming a good fiber source at each meal can help prevent spikes in
          blood sugar and insulin levels, which may help reduce your risk of
          developing diabetes.
        </p>
        <h3>10. Optimize Vitamin D Levels</h3>
        <p>
          Consuming foods high in vitamin D or taking supplements can help
          optimize vitamin D blood levels, which can reduce your risk of
          diabetes.
        </p>
        <h3>11. Minimize Your Intake of Processed Foods</h3>
        <p>
          Minimizing processed foods and focusing on whole foods with protective
          effects on health may help decrease the risk of diabetes.
        </p>
        <h3>12. Drink Coffee or Tea</h3>
        <p>
          Drinking coffee or tea may help reduce blood sugar levels, increase
          insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of diabetes.
        </p>
        <h3>13. Consider Taking These Natural Herbs</h3>
        <p>
          The herbs curcumin and berberine increase insulin sensitivity, reduce
          blood sugar levels and may help prevent diabetes.
        </p>
        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>
          You have control over many of the factors that influence diabetes.
          Rather than viewing prediabetes as a stepping stone to diabetes, it
          may be helpful to see it as a motivator for making changes that can
          help reduce your risk. Eating the right foods and adopting other
          lifestyle behaviors that promote healthy blood sugar and insulin
          levels will give you the best chance at avoiding diabetes.
